<h2>The electoral system</h2>
<p>You will be asked to fill in a preferential ballot: in other words, rank the
candidates. The candidate you prefer most should be #1, then your next
preferences in decreasing order. Don't rank candidates you don't support.
<p>Votes will be counted according to BC-STV (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC-STV">explanation</a>),
which is essentially a generalization of instant-runoff voting.</p>

<p>Voting is anonymous. You will be asked to log in to an authentication service
run by the School of Computer Science to verify that you are an eligible voter,
and then returned to the CCSS voting server. The SCS does not pass on your
identity.</p>

<h2>The candidates</h2>
<p>There are 2 First Year Representative positions. Here are the candidates:

<ul>
  <li>Rebecca Bartoszewica
  <li>Kyle Bjornson
